He attempts to reunite with his brother Koutarou, who left Germany five years ago to study robotics at a university. Unfortunately, no sooner than his brother begins an exhibition about an advanced form of machine, he's kidnapped by a mecha in the shape of a wasp and a servant of the Machine Empire. Teppei starts a chase, using a gauntlet known as the \"Messiah Fist\" to hold onto the wasp as it travels to a secretive base in the Gobi Desert which serves as the Empire's headquarters.\n\nGetting thrown into a garbage heap and facing a cyborg he somehow is familiar with, Teppei's blood awakens a relic from the past; a kirin-type B't known only as \"X\" which, five years ago, was considered the most powerful B't in existence. Both are equally stubborn, although quite different in many ways, and after a few initial squabbles, X resolves to help Teppei in his quest to save his brother.\n\n(Source: TVTropes)",

      "synopsis": "Subaru Sumeragi is the 13th head of his powerful onmyouji clan. Until the time comes when he must succeed his grandmother fully, Subaru is allowed to live in Tokyo with his fraternal twin, Hokuto. While Subaru is kind and shy, Hokuto has exuberance to spare, and her favorite pastime is designing bold matching outfits for the two of them to wear. Her next favorite thing to do is try to set up Subaru with their veterinarian friend Seishirou Sakurazuka who, oddly enough, is always readily available to accompany the Sumeragis throughout the city.\n\nSubaru has to resolve a variety of spiritual conflicts in Tokyo: some are cases formally brought to him by clients, and others are matters in which he decides to involve himself. A selfless teenager, he empathizes with others to the point that their pain may as well be his own. This leaves him vulnerable in a city where nearly everyone makes decisions that only benefit themselves as individuals. Hokuto hopes that if Subaru develops feelings for Seishirou, their relationship will be the one thing that he never gives up for the sake of anyone else. However, is Seishirou the best candidate for her brother's love, or is he hiding sinister secrets?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

When his caretaker, the old ARM-smith that took him in after his parents' deaths, sends him out on an errand, he is attacked by a bandit from \"chess\"! In his escape attempt, he finds more than he bargained for when he comes across Babbo! But, now with Babbo's awakening, the fake ARMs are going out of control!

      "synopsis": "Often considered untrustworthy, Japanese ninja were in fact unwaveringly loyal to their masters. But in modern-day Japan, high school student and self-proclaimed ninja Rekka Hanabishi finds it difficult to carry on their legacy, that is, until he saves a cute girl named Yanagi Sakoshita from a group of delinquents.\n\nIn the aftermath of the event, Rekka deems Yanagi worthy of being his master, swearing to protect her. As a sign of their trust, the two reveal their most valuable secrets to each other: Yanagi can quickly heal wounds, while Rekka can create fire with just a snap of his fingers. However, their dazzling exchange does not go unnoticed as a mysterious woman called Kage Houshi appears. She somehow knows about their powers and threatens them, claiming Rekka must be returned, for he is the only one who can kill her.\n\nThe pair hold their ground, but before things can escalate any further, Kage Houshi calmly leaves. Thinking the crisis is over, Rekka and Yanagi continue their daily lives, unaware that they are about to be dragged into a centuries-long ninja conspiracy with the lives of their friends and their own on the line.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Their quest is to destroy each of the Platina stones- the objects the evil sorcerers use for creating their black magic - in an entertaining mix of farce and adventure.\n\n(Source: Tokyopop)",

Initially believing to be on a graduation trip, Shuuya Nanahara and the rest of Shiroiwa Junior High's Class B find that they have been chosen to participate in this game of life and death known as The Program.\n\nWaking up to the realization that they have been quarantined on an island, the 42 students discover they have been fitted with metal collars which will detonate if certain conditions are not met. In order to obtain freedom, they must slaughter everyone else by whatever means necessary, and the last one standing is deemed the winner. As each member of the class heads down their own path, Shuuya makes it his goal to get off the island without playing the game in order to put an end to this madness once and for all.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Beck tells the story of the love and trial that accompanies pursuing a professional career in music as Koyuki and Ray work toward realizing the guitarist's dream of the ultimate band.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
