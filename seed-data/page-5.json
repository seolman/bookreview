When she and her adoptive father, Yousuke, move to a new city, the energetic young girl naturally sets out to investigate the neighborhood on her own.\n\nAfter a few incidents at the local park, the Koiwais become acquainted with their neighbors, the Ayase family. Their three daughters\u2014mischievous college student Asagi, responsible high school student Fuuka, and kindhearted grade school student Ena\u2014eventually all take a liking to Yotsuba and join in on her antics, despite their sheer ridicule.\n\nFrom learning how to use a swing to figuring out how to stop global warming with air conditioners, Yotsuba's ability to infallibly find fun in everything, both amazes and annoys the people around her. Along with Yousuke, the Ayases, and friends she makes along the way, Yotsuba embarks on daily adventures, each one a step in her quest to enjoy the simple things in life.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

      "synopsis": "After enduring four years of high school, Hideki Motosuwa strives to get into the university of his choice by attending cram school in Tokyo. Concurrently, he works daily shifts at a bar to make ends meet, thus missing out on the world's latest invention\u2014human-like computers called Persocoms. Longing for a persocom of his own, Hideki is met with a stroke of luck when he stumbles upon a cute abandoned persocom in a garbage pile.\n\nUpon finding the power button, Hideki finds his newfound robot to be faulty and only capable of uttering the word \"Chii\"\u2014which Hideki decides to name her after. Chii, however, is no ordinary persocom: capable of thinking and learning on her own, she is a legendary type of robot known as a Chobit. Now, it is up to Hideki to teach Chii how to live an ordinary life and to uncover the truth behind the elusive chobits series.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Mahoro is Vesper\\'s most powerful battle android and has won many battles, but she has little operating time left and soon will cease to function. However, if she lays down her arms and conserves her remaining power, the time she has left can be prolonged to just over a year. Mahoro is given an opportunity to live the remaining time she has as a normal human. She chooses to live as a maid for Suguru, a phenomenally messy high school student who lives by himself after his family passed away.\n\n(Source: ANN)",

Having a leaf imprinted onto his hand by code, Kazuhiko is entrusted with a secret task to deliver a \"package\"\u2014a girl with white hair and evergreen eyes whom he finds singing in a birdcage-like building. All Kazuhiko knows is that her name is Suu, and for whatever reason, she wishes to go to Fairy Park.\n\nAs his friends Lan and Gingetsu help set up a transport module for the duo, Kazuhiko suspects that there is more to Suu than he knows. Not only is their transport intercepted, but the two are also pursued by Bols\u2014a face that is uncomfortably familiar to Kazuhiko and who seems to have received his own mission to seek out Suu. The truth behind the discreet nature of this operation, Suu's existence, and even a possible connection between her and Kazuhiko may all be linked to just one word: clover.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But for it to be granted, she must learn how to heal the wounded hearts of the people and collect them in a magic bottle.\n\nHowever, the world can be confusing for such an innocent girl. Her companion Ioryogi can be quite rough in teaching her common sense, especially for a talking blue dog plushie! Luckily for Kobato, a certain quaint place with a troubled history seems to be\u2014and may be looking for\u2014a glimmer of hope.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

They are soon greeted by Guru Clef, a youthful-looking man who informs them that they are the legendary Magic Knights summoned by Princess Emeraude to save this magical land known as Cephiro.\n\nWhile Hikaru finds the prospect exciting, Umi and Fuu simply want to return to their own world. Unfortunately for them, Clef explains that they cannot go home until they have saved Cephiro and banished the monsters plaguing it. In order to do so, they have to rescue Princess Emeraude from the clutches of the powerful Lord Zagato. To stand a chance against him, they must revive mysterious beings called Rune Gods.\n\nAs Clef grants the trio armor and magic, one of Zagato's servants attacks, forcing the guru to send the girls away to the weaponsmith Presea and the rabbit-like guide Mokona, who can further equip them for their journey. Though they have a long way to go, Hikaru, Umi, and Fuu will show that they have what it takes to live up to their titles as Magic Knights and bring salvation to Cephiro.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Aqua's capital, Neo-Venezia, is a near-perfect copy of the wonderful, dreamy city of Venice back on Manhome\u2014previously known as Earth. Citizens and tourists alike take their time exploring the city and admiring its rustic charm, especially by riding one of the many gondolas gliding along the waterways.\n\nHighly skilled and knowledgeable women known as Undines navigate the gondolas and act as tour guides of Neo-Venezia. Originating from Manhome, several well-renowned Undine companies have made their home in the capital, with many young girls aspiring to join their ranks.\n\nChasing her dream of becoming an Undine, Manhome native Akari Mizunashi begins her training as an apprentice at the Aria Company. Soon after arriving in town, she becomes acquainted with her mentor Alicia Florence, a pudgy cat named Aria Pokoteng, and Aika S. Granzchesta, a fellow Undine apprentice from the Himeya Company. Together with her new friends, Akari strives to become a full-fledged Undine while taking in all the magical sights and sounds that Neo-Venezia generously offers.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 2: Othello Game (Ebony &amp; Ivory)",

      "synopsis": "The great warrior Leon Manas, son of the legendary Nathan Manas, now carries the powerful sword Brumhart. Though this blade is coveted by many, only the heirs to the House of Manas can wield it. But that doesn\u2019t stop the sinister from trying. Ernan, once trusted knight of the House of Manas, murders his commander, robs him Brumhart and orders the death of Leon\u2019s only son, Zian. But the men sent to perform this infanticide come up against a mysterious figure in a dark cloak who defeats them only to disappear with child into the thick of the Tass Forest. Sixteen years later, Ernan has become a feared tyrant, but still has not been able to unsheathe Brumhart. Thus begins the tale of this desperate king and the young boy who would be one.\n\n(Source: Tokyopop)",

The store's proprietor is an enigmatic young man who goes by the name of Count D.\n\nCount D welcomes those who feel lonely and wounded through the doors of his shop, claiming to sell \"love, dreams, and hope\" in the form of the fantastic beasts that lie within. Each creature comes with a special contract accompanied by a set of rules. However, he warns customers that he cannot be held accountable for any consequences of breaking the rules.\n\nShort-tempered detective Leon Orcot traces the source of several crimes back to Count D and what the former considers to be a pet shop of horrors. Determined to find proof that the Count is a criminal, he begins to pay regular visits to the shop.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
